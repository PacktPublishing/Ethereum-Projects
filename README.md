# Ethereum Projects [Video]
This is the code repository for [Ethereum Projects [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/ethereum-projects-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788623261), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Ethereum enables the development of efficient, smart contracts that contain code. These smart contracts can interact with other smart contracts to make decisions, store data, and send Ether to others.
This course provides you with a clear approach to building cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. Throughout the course, we walk you through a detailed step-by-step process to build advanced Ethereum projects. Each project will teach you just enough about Ethereum to be productive right away. You will learn how tokenization works, how to think in a decentralized way, and how to build Blockchain-based distributed computing systems. You will build interesting projects with Ethereum such as wallets, copyright, secure data sharing, and more. 
By the end of this video, you will be able to tackle Blockchain challenges by implementing projects end-to-end using the full power of the Ethereum Blockchain
